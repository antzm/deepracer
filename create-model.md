# Creating a DeepRacer Model

1. Log in to the AWS Console
2. Search for DeepRacer and select it
3. Create the DeepRacer resources (only needed during the very first time you are using DeepRacer).
4. Go to Garage and build your model  

In this section, we are going to select the configuration of the car that we will use to build our model.  

We have the option to select a car with:

	* One camera
		* Classic DeepRacer configuration
	* Stereo Camera
		* Advanced configuration with two cameras that provides distance information which is useful to calculate the distance from objects and thus, helps to avoid collision with vatious objects on the track, or even other DeepRacer cars that raace on the same track.

5. Create your first model
